          The first place I'd like to introduce is Longxing Temple which
          commonly regarded as a namecard of my homeland. I like there very
          much, because entering Longxing Temple immediately gives one an
          atmosphere of solemnness that contrasts sharply with the noisy world
          outside the walls. Here belongs to history, belongs to eternity, a
          person can not help but think of their own life, feel their own life
          is short. Here, time seemed to be frozen in a moment, and I could see
          the world passing before it, but it was unchanging.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since its establishment, Longxing temple has a history of more than
          1400 years. Its first name is Longzang Temple, built by emperor Kai of
          the Sui Dynasty, and the Tang Dynasty change the name into Longxing
          Temple. In 971, Zhao Kuangyin, emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty,
          extended the temple built the great compassion treasure pavilion, and
          cast a bronze statue of Guanyin with thousands of hands. Since then,
          the following dynasties Jin, Yuan and Ming have repaired and added the
          temple. During the years of Kangxi and Qianlong in Qing Dynasy, it was
          rebuilt twice by the order of the emperors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the present Longxing Temple is actually very large. Here
          you can not only experience history, but also study ancient
          architectural techniques and styles. At present, Longxing Temple
          covers an area of 82,500 square meters, the layout and architecture
          retain the Song Dynasty style.

        <h3>Cangzhou Iron Lion</h3>

          The second place I'd like to introduce is Cangzhou, which is my real
          small hometown in Hebei province. My hometown is a small place
          surrounded by shallow water, this is the reason it get the name of
          “Cangzhou” which means in Chinese: land in the center of water.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most famous thing in my hometown is the iron Lion in Cangzhou. The
          locals call it one of the four treasures. It was built in 953 and has
          a history of 1,000 years. When we were kids, we used to play around
          him with our friends and didn't realize he was so old.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actual length of the lion is more than 6 meters, the body is about
          3 meters wide, the full height is more than 5 meters, the belly is
          hollow, and the weight is 32 tons, which is estimated to have weighed
          more than 40 tons when it was built.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several different theories about the specific purpose of the
          Iron Lion. One holds that the iron lion was cast by convicts during
          the Northern Expedition of Emperor Sezong in the later Zhou Dynasty
          and used for the towns and cities. Another saying is that the iron
          lion is used in Zhenhai, hence the nickname "Zhenhai Roar"; There is
          also a belief that, based on the suspected Diamond Sutra in Iron
          Lion's abdomen and the lotus basin on its back, the Iron Lion should
          have been an annex of a temple, with an image of Manjusri on its back,
          and a white elephant and a statue of a Bodhisattva opposite it.

          The third place I here introduces is Bowness. This is where I am
          living now. 9 months ago, on Dec 1th 2023, I came here with my 10
          years old son. This is where my son will attend his primary school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bowness is a good place because it is in the inside curve of the bow
          river, the river is just like a bow if you look at it in the map. We
          came here in the winter, the trees along the riverbank are leafless.
          But to my amazement, we came to the riverbed one day, because the
          water in the river at this season is almost dry, when we look towards
          the upper bank of the river from the riverbed, the sun shone golden on
          the trees along the river bank, it is a so beautiful a scenery, we
          could never forgot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes we climb to the top of the mountain and look at the scenery
          around us. We also notice that even at the top of the mountain there
          are many round pebbles in the earth, and we infer that
          even the top of the mountain should have been covered by water
          countless years ago. It really makes people have a lot of emotion about the
          vicissitudes of the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also a small church in the neighborhood, we attend the church
          every Sunday morning, the folks there is very friendly towards us. We
          feel at home in the church.
        </p>
        <p>
          After settled down, I realized that I am really luck to choose here to
          begin a new life for my family. I hope you my friend may have a chance
          to visit here.
